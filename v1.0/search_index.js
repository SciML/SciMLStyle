For example, the tolerance of a differential equation solver was set to a default of abstol=1e-6,reltol=1e-3 as a generally correct plot in most cases, and is an expectation from back in the 90's. In that case, using the historically expected and most often useful default tolerances is justified. However, if one implements GradientDescent, the learning rate needs to be adjusted for each application (based on the size of the gradient), and thus a default of GradientDescent(learning_rate = 1) is not recommended.\nArguments which do not have defaults should be preferably made into positional arguments. The newer syntax of required keyword arguments can be useful but should not be abused. Notable exceptions are cases where \"either or\" arguments are accepted, for example of defining g or dgdu is sufficient, then making them both keyword arguments with = nothing and checking that either is not nothing (and throwing an appropriate error) is recommended if distinct dispatches with different types is not possible. \nWhen calling a function always separate your keyword arguments from your positional arguments with a semicolon. This avoids mistakes in ambiguous cases (such as splatting a Dict).\nWhen writing a function that sends a lot of keyword arguments to another function, say sending keyword arguments to a differential equation solver, use a named tuple keyword argument instead of splatting the keyword arguments. For example, use diffeq_solver_kwargs = (; abstol=1e-6, reltol=1e-6,) as the API and use solve(prob, alg; diffeq_solver_kwargs...) instead of splatting all keyword arguments.\nFunctions which mutate arguments should be appended with !.\nAvoid type piracy. I.e., do not add methods to functions you don't own on types you don't own. Either own the types or the function.\nFunctions should prefer instances instead of types for arguments. For example, for a solver type Tsit5, the interface should use solve(prob,Tsit5()), not solve(prob,Tsit5). The reason for this is multifold. For one, passing a type has different specialization rules, so functionality can be slower unless ::Type{Tsit5} is written in the dispatches which use it. Secondly, this allows for default and keyword arguments to extend the choices, which may become useful for some types down the line. Using this form allows adding more options in a non-breaking manner.\nIf the number of arguments is too large to fit into a 92 character line, then use as many arguments as possible within a line and start each new row with the same indentation, preferably at the same column as the ( but this can be moved left if the function name is very long.

Specifying the IO object first permits passing the function to functions such as sprint, e.g. sprint(show, x).\nInput being mutated. For example, in fill!(x, v), x is the object being mutated and it appears before the value to be inserted into x.\nType. Passing a type typically means that the output will have the given type. In parse(Int, \"1\"), the type comes before the string to parse. There are many such examples where the type appears first, but it's useful to note that in read(io, String), the IO argument appears before the type, which is in keeping with the order outlined here.\nInput not being mutated.
